# Maristella's Sample Shop: Ecommerce Website With Django + React

Live website: https://maristellas.herokuapp.com/#/

This project was based on Udemy tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/course/django-with-react-an-ecommerce-website/
Along with Django and React, the website uses AWS for storing data and Heroku for deployment.

The purpose of this website was to create a sample ecommerce website for a client who releases items for sale on biweekly basis.
Hence, this project involved modifying the tutorial's website to be more appropriate for this client's business.
